                <p>We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?  
                    Look, us sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.  You remember... everyone 
                    Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.  Remember... You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. 
                    Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities. </p>

                <p>Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. 
                    I'd ask "where would we go once his plan was complete?". His answer was always the same: "To the Garden."  I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. 
                    But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...  Well, you pulled this off. 
                    I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.  Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. 
                    You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful.
                     Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Are you sure? - Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back.  
                     No amount of money ever bought a second of time.  I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think? </p>

                <p>Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. 
                    Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. 
                    Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. 
                    But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, 
                    and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?  Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.  
                    No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.  No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</p>
